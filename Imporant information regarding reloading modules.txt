Important information regarding reloading modules

If you are hosting a server with these scripts installed, it is very important
that you do NOT reload certain modules without warning.

	- Hannah: Before reloading, type "/updatedb" to ensure players' inventories are saved
	- vehicles: Before reloading, tell people to get out of their vehicles
	- freebuild: Reloading this module will cause some of the angles of build objects
		to go in weird directions. This is because of a bug in the code.
		
All other modules can be reloaded at any time relatively safely without data loss.
