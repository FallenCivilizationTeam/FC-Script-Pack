Adding New Items Tutorial

1. Navigate to lua/autorun/shared/items.lua:

	Add in a new entry, following the examples provided.
	
		ex.
		
			reference["My New Item"] = "Utility"
			rarity["My New Item"] = 3
			stacklimit["My New Item"] = 5
			inlootbox["My New Item"] = true
			
2. Navigate to Hannah/shared/SQLInfo.lua:

	Add in a new entry, following the examples provided.
	The two letter value in the table must NOT be used by any other entries.
	To make sure this is case, simply search for the two letters in the file.
	
	ex.
	
		SQLFormat["My New Item"] = "xq"

	If the two letter value is used more than once in the table, bad things will happen.
	
That's it for simply adding an item.  However, if you want to add a crafting recipe too,
there's a few more steps.

3. Navigate to crafting/shared/recipes.lua:

	Add in a new entry, following the examples provided.
	
	ex.
	
		cRecipes["My New Item"] = {}
		cRecipes["My New Item"].craftReq = 3 <- This is what crafting level is needed
		cRecipes["My New Item"].amtGet = 5 <- Amount you get when you craft one
		cRecipes["My New Item"].craftTime = 10 <- Time it takes to craft
		cRecipes["My New Item"].M1 = "Silver" <- Material 1 name
		cRecipes["My New Item"].M1a = 4 <- Material 1 amount needed
		cRecipes["My New Item"].M2 = "Iron" <- Material 2 name
		cRecipes["My New Item"].M2a = 2 <- Material 2 amount
		
	Technically you can create a recipe that requires any number of materials,
	though more than 10 will likely run off the crafting menu.

4. Navigate to crafting/client/iteminfo.lua:

	Add in a new entry, following the examples provided.
	
	ex. 
	
		itemdesc["My New Item"] = "This item is really cool and awesome!"

	If an item does not have a description yet does have a recipe, crafting will crash.

That's it!  Your item should now appear in the crafting menu.
