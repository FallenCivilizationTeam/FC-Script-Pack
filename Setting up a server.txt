If you want to set up your own FC clone using these scripts, you'll have to do a little bit
of work to get things functioning properly.

1. Set the following settings in config.lua to these specified values:
	
    DeathRespawnTime            = nil
    DeathRemove                 = false
    UnoccupiedRespawnTime       = nil
    UnoccupiedRemove            = false
    IKnowWhatImDoing            = true
	
2. Make yourself an admin:

	Navigate to scripts/nametags3/server/specialplayers.lua
	Add your own Steam ID in the sp table following the examples provided.
	
3. Delete the database:

	Find and delete server.db in the root of the server hierarchy.
	This ensures that every player who joins will have a fresh start and there are no
	database anomalies at boot.
	
4. Start the server and join:

	You should find yourself at Newbie Island, and there should be loot scattered around as
	well as vehicles and helpful messages.

If you are having trouble following these instructions then it is recommended that you
read tutorials on setting up a server for JC2MP on the wiki.  It is also recommended that
you read through a few of their Lua tutorials as well.
