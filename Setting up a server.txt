If you want to set up your own FC clone using these scripts, you'll have to do a little bit
of work to get things functioning properly.

1. Set the following settings in config.lua to these specified values:
	
    DeathRespawnTime            = nil
    DeathRemove                 = false
    UnoccupiedRespawnTime       = nil
    UnoccupiedRemove            = false
    IKnowWhatImDoing            = true
	
2. Add these scripts to the scripts folder:

	TimeChange: https://github.com/Jasonmrc/TimeChange
	Bank: https://github.com/Philpax/jc2mp-bank
	GUIPM: https://github.com/Castillos15/guipm
	WarpGUI: https://github.com/Eraknelo/WarpGUI
	
	Some of these scripts were slightly modified from their original versions.
	
	TimeChange: No changes.
	Bank: A few GUI updates and command changes.
	GUIPM: Server print messages.
	WarpGUI: Restricted to those with the Admin or Mod tag, removed chat messages, removed
	accept/decline features, and removed appear/disappear effects.
	
	The server absolutely REQUIRES TimeChange and Bank, however the other two are not necessary.
	
	Also make sure that you know how to use autorun and that you put the required scripts in it.
	Many scripts (including loot) will not function properly if this is not set up correctly.
	
3. Make yourself an admin:

	Navigate to scripts/nametags3/server/specialplayers.lua
	Add your own Steam ID in the sp table following the examples provided.
	
4. Delete the database:

	Find and delete server.db in the root of the server hierarchy.
	This ensures that every player who joins will have a fresh start and there are no
	database anomalies at boot.
	
5. Start the server and join:

	You should find yourself at Newbie Island, and there should be loot scattered around as
	well as vehicles and helpful messages.

If you are having trouble following these instructions then it is recommended that you
read tutorials on setting up a server for JC2MP on the wiki.  It is also recommended that
you read through a few of their Lua tutorials as well.
