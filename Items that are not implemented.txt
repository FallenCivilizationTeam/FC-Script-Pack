Items that are not implemented

Fins, Headlamp, Air Generator - These were part of the underwater module which has
	been removed from this pack because of the many problems it creates with different
	clients.  The module will be released in a later pack.
	
Airstrike - This item was planned for implementation, but the script was never
	finished for it.
	
Implosion Trap - The implementation for this is essentially done; it just has
	a few bugs that need fixing.
	
Rope - The implementation of this is essentially done and some have seen it in
	action on the server; this script will be released in script pack 2.
