------------------PACK OUTLINE------------------------
Administrative Tools - This folder contains all of the scripts that do NOT go on the main server. Instead,
these are meant for your personal development server so that you can place loot and vehicles and whatnot.
More detailed instructions on how to use each module are within the folder.

lua - This folder contains all of the scripts that need to be placed in autorun. If you do not know how
to do this, it is recommended that you read a server guide on the JC2MP wiki.

scripts - These are all of the scripts that make the server work as it should.  These should be placed in
your scripts folder as it implies.

-----------------------------------------------------

Also please be aware that many of these scripts are dependent on Hannah, the loot module.  Many of
them will not work on their own and will need some modification if you want to do so. Some of the scripts
are also dependent on nametags.

A few scripts will not be released as part of this pack due to different reasons.  These scripts offer
nothing to enhance the core gameplay of the scripts, and are not necessary for the server.

If you have questions regarding specific scripts, please don't hesitate to ask.  Detailed tutorials
on specific module usage may also be created if there are requests.  There are many commands hidden
within each module, most of which are admin/moderator only.

Please keep in mind that those with legacy renderer on will have a difficult time playing on the
server.  This is mainly due to the underwater module, which renders air bubbles underneath the
ground.  If this is an issue, consider removing the underwater module.  Removing this module
will create a few problems with other modules, though.

Will the players from the old server keep their nametags (alpha, beta, etc)?
No.  We will not be releasing the file with all of the nametags of players.
