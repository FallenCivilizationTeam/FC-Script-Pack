Administrative Tools - This folder contains all of the scripts that do NOT go on the main server. Instead,
these are meant for your personal development server so that you can place loot and vehicles and whatnot.
More detailed instructions on how to use each module are within the folder.

lua - This folder contains all of the scripts that need to be placed in autorun. If you do not know how
to do this, it is recommended that you read a server guide on the JC2MP wiki.

scripts - These are all of the scripts that make the server work as it should.  These should be placed in
your scripts folder as it implies.

-----------------------------------------------------

Also please be aware that many of these scripts are dependent on Hannah, the loot module.  Many of
them will not work on their own and will need some modification if you want to do so. Some of the scripts
are also dependent on nametags.

If you have questions regarding specific scripts, please don't hesitate to ask.  Detailed tutorials
on specific module usage may also be created if there are requests.  There are many commands hidden
within each module, most of which are admin/moderator only.

Will the players from the old server keep their nametags (alpha, beta, etc)?
No.  We will not be releasing the file with all of the nametags of players.
